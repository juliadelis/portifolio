  "PortifolioPageTitle": "JDelis",
  "PortifolioPageDescription": "Born from my passion for design and technology, this project reflects my journey as an Interaction Designer and Front-End Developer, blending creativity, interactivity, and digital experiences that captivate.",
  "PortifolioPageAbout": "This portfolio was born from the desire to tell my story, from my roots as an Interaction Designer to my current path as a Front-End Developer. Each project is presented to reflect the values that guide my work: creativity, interactivity, dynamism, and experiences that truly connect. The website’s visual identity was crafted from the ground up, embodying both my design vision and my developer’s mindset.",
  "PortifolioPageChallenge": "The biggest challenge was shaping a visual identity that truly reflects who I am and how I aspire to be seen in the world. I sought to balance the creativity of a designer with the precision of a developer, crafting a language that feels clear, engaging, and authentic. More than a portfolio, this website became both a canvas for self-expression and a stage to showcase my projects and skills.",
  "PortifolioPageSolution": "The solution was to develop a unique visual identity that combined aesthetics and functionality, reflecting the way I work and communicate. I chose a modern and interactive design that favors fluid navigation and immersion in each project. Colors, typography, and layouts were carefully designed to convey dynamism and creativity, while the site’s structure emphasizes clarity and user experience. In this way, the portfolio became more than just a collection of works: it is also an expression of my journey and my vision of digital creation.",
  "PortifolioPageLogoTitle": "Incorporating identity",
  "PortifolioPageLogoDescription": "The logo merges elegance with personality, shaped by a refined and fluid typography. The interplay of gentle curves and bold lines embodies the pillars of my identity: creativity, dynamism, and authenticity. It strikes a balance between the artistry of design and the precision of development, projecting a modern, confident presence that tells the story of my journey.",

  "EraPageTitle": "ERA Principal",
  "EraPageDescription": "ERA Principle is not just fashion. It is an invitation to step inside the future of clothing—where technology and style converge through Augmented Reality",
  "EraPageAbout": "Born in São Paulo as a final university project, ERA challenges the boundaries of design. We asked ourselves: what if a t-shirt could tell a story, move, and transform? The answer was AR. Through the ERA app, every piece becomes alive, glowing with interactive animations ready to be shared with the world.",
  "EraPageChallenge": "Fashion is expressive, yet static. Our challenge was to make it move, to merge the physical with the digital without losing style, elegance, or accessibility.",
  "EraPageSolution": "We developed an interactive AR experience using the Vuforia Engine in collaboration with Unity. By applying image recognition to the t-shirt’s print, we enabled a colorful, animated butterfly pattern to appear in real time. This duality between the physical (black-and-white print) and the digital (vibrant animation) creates a striking contrast and reinforces the concept of blending fashion with innovation.",
  "EraPageLogoTitle": "Intertwined Identity",
  "EraPageLogoDescription": "With a unique typographic logo and the key element of motion design, we seek to convey the idea of innovation. The movement of the intertwined logo evokes a sense of interaction and also pays tribute to streetwear, adding a graffiti-inspired touch.",
  "EraPageColorsTitle": "New Realities",
  "EraPageColorsDescription": "The choice of colors reflects this balance between contrast and energy. Eight bold, vivid tones were selected to stand out against neutral black and white, ensuring that the experience feels both dynamic and striking. Together, they embody the duality at the heart of ERA—simplicity on the surface, and a world of color when technology unlocks its hidden layers.",
  "EraPageWebsiteTitle": "Echoes of the Experience",
  "EraPageWebsiteDescription": "The website itself was designed to reflect ERA’s core values: innovation, creativity, and interaction. Built with a clean, modern structure, it highlights both the physical and digital aspects of the project. Motion design and interactive elements mirror the AR experience, making the platform not just an exhibition but an extension of the brand’s vision.",
  "EraPageEnding": "ERA is more than a project—it’s a glimpse into the future of fashion. By merging creativity and technology, we aim to inspire new ways of experiencing style, where every garment tells a story beyond fabric."
